Hey, welcome to Block Secured, an open-source education in blockchain and smart contract security.

The aim is to provide a comprehensive curriculum for free, targeting existing security professionals who are just new to these concepts.

I started this to do something with my notes, help others learn faster, and ultimately keep our happy blockchain future a little safer.

I wrote this post to see how my Markdown-to-static-site pipeline is working. Look OK?

Anyway, very happy you are here. Enjoy the content first. Leave us feedback [**on Github**](https://github.com/blocksecured/blocksecured) second.

Thanks!!

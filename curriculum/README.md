# Block Secured curriculum

The actual curriculum of the Block Secured website ([https://blocksecured.com](https://blocksecured.com)).

The `master` branch here gets ingested and published there.

See [**the website repo**](https://github.com/blocksecured/blocksecured) for more information on the project and that process.

## Contributing

There are two ways to contribute - (1) issues or (2) actually forking, writing, doing a pull request.

Note that any web app specific stuff (bugs) should go in [that repo](https://github.com/blocksecured/blocksecured).

Similarly, specific how-to's or more short-term stuff (fads, news) are better suited for [the blog repo](https://github.com/blocksecured/blog).

#### Issues

Is there something you want to see in the course? Something that could be covered better?

Please add an issue - this is the easiest way to contribute!

#### Pull requests

You can also fork the project, work on whatever, then make a pull request.

Just note that all commits should (ideally) link to an issue number.

# How not to get rekt

To continue building your smart contract skills and introduce some tooling (!!), we're going to have you do a workshop. Specifically the one Consensys Diligence put on at DevCon4.

## Required exercise

The "How not to get rekt" workshop necessitates cloning 2 Git repos that can be found below.

[**ConsenSys/devcon4**](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4)

[**ConsenSys/devcon4-playground**](https://github.com/ConsenSys/devcon4-playground)

Then follow the README in that first repo. It'll be fun.

## Optional/alternative software

You might want to check out Ethereum Hackbox as an alternative and (we think) *easier* way to set up Mythril.

Mythril Classic is a tool you will use in the workshop.

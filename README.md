# Ethereum Security Course

This is an open source education around Ethereum security which lives at https://ethsec.io/course.

It is meant to bring "traditional" application security engineers up to speed.

This is *not* a course in becoming a security engineer from scratch.

## History

This course and the wider Ethereum Security Blog site were started by [Randy Gingeleski](https://github.com/gingeleski) as a means to share notes and help others learn.

This effort was heavily inspired by [The Odin Project](https://github.com/theodinproject) which Randy used to learn web development.

## Contributing

Now it's your turn to be part of the story. The website depends on open source contributions to grow, improve, and thrive.

### Repos

Quick note on the whole website's repo organization.

Blog content should be attributed to that [**parent repo**](https://github.com/ethereumsec/ethereumsec.github.io).

Curriculum/course content should be attributed *here*.

### Issues

Easiest way to contribute. Open an issue in any of the repos with a suggestion, bug, or idea.

### Pull requests

You can also fork the project, work on whatever, then make a pull request.

Just note that all commits should (ideally) link to an issue number.
